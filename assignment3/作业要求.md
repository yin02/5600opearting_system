## Part 1: Memory Layout

### Question 1a (15 Points)
Stacks on almost all modern CPUs grow down, using lower memory addresses as more data is pushed onto the stack. The heap refers to memory allocated by `malloc()` or the C++ or Java `new` operator. A typical heap allocator will start with a certain amount of memory and allocate more if that runs out.

Consider the following memory layout for a single program running in a fixed address space (here we assume addresses 0000-FFFF are all available to the program, and no others):

In this organization, the fixed-sized components of the program – the code and the pre-allocated data – are placed starting at the bottom of the address space. They are followed by the heap, which is allowed to expand upwards (towards higher addresses) as more memory is allocated. Finally, the stack begins at the top of the address space and grows down towards the heap.

If memory is laid out in this manner, what happens when the stack and the heap meet in the middle? Explain, in your own words, what would occur and what the consequences of that event would be on the program.

### Question 1b (15 Points)
For single-user operating systems without memory protection (e.g., the CSx600, Z80, or Intel 808x) applications are able to make direct function calls to operating system code, yet most operating systems which ran on such computers (e.g., MS-DOS, early MacOS) provided a system call table for making indirect calls into the operating system, and these tables were almost universally used by applications. Describe a reason for using such a table, i.e., a case in which a program calling operating system addresses directly might fail in some cases, while one using the system call table would not.

### Question 1c (20 Points)
What is wrong with the following C code fragment? Describe the issue or issues and how you would need to modify the code to avoid any potential problems.

```c
char* block = calloc(2048);
memset(&block, 0xFF, 2048);
```

## Part 2: Memory Management

Prior to working on this part, review these lessons and refer to them as you work:
Narang, Prateek. Memory Layout in C.

### (10 pts) 
Write a C program called `allocmem.c` (that compiles to an executable called `allocmem`) that allocates 10 megabytes of storage from the heap, 5 MB of storage from the static segment, and 1 MB from the stack. In your program, consider how the memory is tracked and write comments in your program when the memory is allocated and when it is returned to the operating system. What happens to the memory when your program exits and the associated process in which it ran is deleted?

### (30 pts) 
Write a C program called `loadmem.c` (that compiles to an executable called `loadmem`) that defines a structure (using `struct` with `typedef` and called `dyn_block`) storing an array of integers. Define the structure as needed for the remainder of the assignment. The array of integers (`data array`) should be allocated dynamically as needed to some specific and predefined size. Write a function called `alloc_dyn_block()` that allocates a single instance of a `dyn_block` from the heap and returns a pointer to that allocated object. You may define the signature as needed. Define another function called `store_mem_blk()` which stores an array of integers in a dynamic block (a `dyn_block` object) previously allocated.

### (10 pts) 
Read integers from this data file (`blocks.data`) and load the integers on a line into a dynamic block. Each line of integers should be in a separate dynamic block. Naturally, you will need to download and save the data file locally in order to read it. Demonstrate that the data was read correctly. Write additional functions as needed.

## Submission
For Part 1, provide your written answers in the space provided or submit a PDF containing your written answers.

For Part 2, submit a single `.tar` file (`emailid-cs5600-f24-week4.tar`) that contains your source files and the makefile:

- Source and header files containing all of your code and signatures
- Makefile with different targets

Programs that do not compile or throw an error during execution will not receive any credit, so be sure to test properly. Check your submission (all files) before and after submitting. We cannot accept any files or updates after the assignment submission is closed. You may submit as often as you like; we will only grade the last submission. Do not submit executables (source files and makefile only).

You can copy and paste this markdown into your document or editor as needed!
